This is the production web application for the smart nordic walking stick. It connects via bluetooth low energy (BLE) to the smart nordic walking stick. Intially it was built with MongoDB, using atlas, but the volume of time series data generated by the device greatly exceeded the free tier of atlas, and was removed. In it's place the time series data is printed out so you can view the data as it streams real time.
